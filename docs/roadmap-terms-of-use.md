# data.kitware.com Roadmap: Terms of Use/User Agreement

User Agreement, or Terms of Use, is a way to force users to agree to certain terms of use for a particular dataset, before they'll be given access to that dataset. The User Agreement is tied to a specific root folder, and is a specific block of text that the folder owner can set. When a user wants to browse that root folder from the web client, they must agree to the terms of the user agreement--set by the folder owner through the terms of use text--before the browsing user will be allowed to see the data. Once the browsing user has agreed to the terms of use, they will not need to agree to those terms again in the future to browse the data. If the terms of use text is changed by the root folder owner, browsing users are shown the updated text and must agree to the new terms of use text before being allowed to browse. This enforcement is only through the web client, and not through the REST API.
